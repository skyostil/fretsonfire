Building and installing Frets on Fire
-------------------------------------

Running the game
----------------

First, the following supporting Python libraries should be installed.

	- Python 2.4 or later
	- PyGame
	- PyOpenGL and a video card with recent OpenGL drivers
	- Python Imaging Library
	- numpy
	- Optional: psyco specializing compiler
	- Optional: vorbis-tools for importing Guitar Hero (tm) songs

After this, the game can be started by running the src/FretsOnFire.py file. For
example, in Linux and Mac OS X this can be done from the terminal with the
following commands:

	$ cd src
	$ python FretsOnFire.py

Updating translations
---------------------

First, make sure you have installed the gettext-dev or equivalent package that
provides the msgfmt tool. Then, run the following command:

        $ make translations

Updating graphics files
-----------------------

Frets on Fire requires that all graphic files be provided in the PNG format. 
If you have changed any of the source SVG files, first make sure that Inkscape
is installed. Then, run the following command:

        $ make graphics

Making an installation package
------------------------------

A redistributable installation package for the game can be created as follows.

For Windows:

	1. Install Nullsoft's NSIS installation system.
           Note: Frets on Fire assumes that the NSIS tool can be found at 
           c:/Program Files/NSIS/makeNSIS.exe. This can be overridden by 
           passing the parameter MAKENSIS=<path to makeNSIS.exe> to make in
           the following step.

        2. Install py2exe.

	3. Run the following command

		$ make dist

        The installer will be created in the dist/win32/installer folder.

For Mac OS X:

	1. Install py2app.

	2. Run the following command

		$ make dist

        The installation binary will be created in the dist/mac folder.

Additionally, a generic source distribution package can be created as follows.

        1. Run

                $ make sdist

        The package will be created in the dist folder.
