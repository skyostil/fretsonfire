Raspberry Pi notes
==================

- python-imaging is needed.
- glUniformMatrix* parameter order was wrong in pogles.
- Main framebuffer alpha needs to be properly written because the display.
  hardware composites it on top of the framebuffer.
- MVP = projection * modelview.
- Should get rid of redundant matrix transposes.
- Trying out python-ogg and python-pyvorbis to avoid having to decode the
  entire song to RAM.
